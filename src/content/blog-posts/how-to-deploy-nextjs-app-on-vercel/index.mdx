For new projects, we can build our entire API with API routes, but if we already have an existing API we don't need to forward our API calls through an API route. We could also use API calls if we want to mask our API or an external service (instead of `https://mycompany.com/secret-api-url`, we can send requests to `/api`).

To create an API handler, we need to create a file in `pages/api` and export a default async function:

```typescript
// pages/api/user.ts

import type { NextApiHandler } from "next";

const handler: NextApiHandler = async (req, res) => {
  return res.status(200).json({ name: "John Doe" });
};

export default handler;
```
